ReaCoMa is a project developed by [James Bradbury](https://jamesbradbury.xyz). The project brings the power of the [FluCoMa tools](https://www.flucoma.org) to REAPER. 

This site acts as documentation for the project and provides instruction on installation as well as further development using the ReaComa library that is implemented in the package.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesb93/reacoma) along with the [**latest release as a zip**](https://github.com/jamesb93/ReaCoMa/archive/master.zip).

Thank you to [Pierre Alexandre Tremblay](https://www.pierrealexandretremblay.com) for guiding me through the process of developing ReaCoMa. The command line tools themselves are not my own work, but a product of the FluCoMa project which can be found here. Part of this work was generously funded by the Huddersfield Creative Coding Lab.
