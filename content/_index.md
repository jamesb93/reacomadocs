ReaCoMa is a project developed by [James Bradbury](https://jamesbradbury.xyz). The project brings the power of the [FluCoMa tools](https://www.flucoma.org) to REAPER. 

Thank you to Pierre Alexandre Tremblay for guiding me through the process of developing ReaCoMa. The command line tools themselves are not my own work, but a product of the FluCoMa project which can be found here. Part of this work was generously funded by the Huddersfield Creative Coding Lab.
